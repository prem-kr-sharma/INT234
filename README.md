# INT234
This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to analyze structured datasets and extract meaningful insights. The dataset is first preprocessed through data cleaning, handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling to ensure data quality and consistency. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand data distribution, relationships, and key patterns. Multiple machine learning models are then trained to perform prediction and classification tasks based on the processed data. Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess accuracy and reliability. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from raw data processing to analytical interpretation and result evaluation.
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze student survey data related to minor selection, technical proficiency, interests, and satisfaction levels. Through systematic dataset preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, meaningful patterns and relationships were identified among various skill-based and decision- related attributes. Supervised learning models were effectively used to perform classification and regression tasks, while unsupervised clustering helped uncover hidden student groups with similar skill profiles and interests. Comparative evaluation of multiple algorithms highlighted the effectiveness of ensemble models in handling complex and mixed-type data. Overall, the project illustrates how data-driven approaches can support academic decision- making and provide valuable insights into student behavior and preferences.
